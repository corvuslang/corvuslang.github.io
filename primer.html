    <h1>What the heck is a Corvus!?</h1>
    <p>An introduction to scripting with Corvus</p>
  </header>
  <main>
    <section>
      <p>
        <em>Corvus</em> is a friendly language for scripting just about anything. This guide introduces the language for those
        of us who aren't mega-programmers (yet üí™) with bite-sized examples.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the way, the name "Corvus" comes from the family of birds that includes Crows and Ravens. They are highly intelligent,
        have adapted to a wide variety of climates, can work in groups, and are incredibly persistent. We hope Corvus inspires
        these same qualities.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Numbers</h2>
      <blockquote>
        Ok, so... programming huh? Am I going to need maths for this?
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        <em>Relax,</em> there will be a little arithmetic, but we'll make the computer do it for us. First, let's get our bearings...</p>

      <p>
        <span class="underline">This guide is interactive</span>. Wherever you see an example, the yellow box is a
        <em>script</em>
        and the grey box shows the result of running that script. When you can change the contents of the yellow box you will see
        results automatically. Your first script is just a single number:
        <code>42</code>.
      </p>
      <div class="example" data-title="numbers" data-no-inputs="true">42</div>
      <p>
        That's right, this script is
        <em>yours</em> now. Go ahead and change the number, the result will change with it. If you change the script to something
        that isn't a number, like "cheese grater", you might see an error: the grey box will turn pink and show an error
        message. No big deal ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, it's just a box. Change the yellow box back to a number and you're set.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ok, so how about that arithmetic? To get the computer to do our calculations, we're going to use a
        <em>function</em> named
        <code>calc</code>. Functions are how we ask the computer questions, and when we use a function in a script we say we're
        <em>calling</em> the function.
      </p>
      <blockquote style="display: flex; border-left: none">
        <div style="font-size: 2rem; margin-right: 1rem; align-self: center;">‚òéÔ∏è</div>
        <div style="font-style: oblique">
          Hey
          <code>calc</code>, how've you been? ... yeah? ... hey so um... what really? no! I can't believe he did that! What a ...
          right, right. Why was I calling? Oh right, I was wondering if you could help me out with something ... what's twelve
          plus thirty?
        </div>
      </blockquote>
      <div class="example" data-title='calling a function' data-no-inputs="true">calc: 12 plus: 30</div>
      <p>
        Computers are quite dull compared to people, they don't interrupt us with juicy gossip when we call, just give us the boring
        answer straight away: "forty-two",
        <em>click.</em> üòë ... but that's also why we love them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just like the calculator you had in school (or the calculator app on your phone),
        <code>calc</code> can do more than add. You can ask
        <code>calc</code> to do more calculations by adding more
        <em>keywords</em> to the call. In
        <em>addition</em> (üò¨) to
        <code>plus</code>,
        <code>calc</code> understands the keywords
        <code>subtract</code>,
        <code>times</code>, and
        <code>dividedBy</code>. Just like a pocket calculator, it performs these operations in the order they are written, here's
        a longer example to demonstrate:</p>
      <div class="example" data-title="a bit more calculation" data-no-inputs="true">calc: 10 times: 2 plus: 1 dividedBy: 3 times: 6</div>
      <p>
        Remember how these examples are interactive? I want you to really go to town on this one. Add like a hundred different calculator
        operations. If you don't make the grey box turn pink at least once, you're not really
        <strong>
          <em>living</em>
        </strong>.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2 id="more-functions">More functions and variables</h2>
      <p>
        You've mastered
        <code>calc</code>, but having just one function is a lot like having a phone that only calls one person, so let's expand
        our repertoire (or is it an entourage? ü§î).
      </p>
      <p>
        Next up we're going to ask the computer another easy question: is one number bigger than another?
      </p>
      <div class="example" data-no-inputs="true" data-title="comparing numbers">compare: 10 biggerThan: 20</div>
      <p>
        Why bother asking the computer a question with an obvious answer? To answer that we need to introduce
        <em>variables</em>. This next example shows a new capability: if you write a word (like
        <code>rewardPoints</code>), Corvus assumes that it refers to a number that comes from outside your script.
      </p>
      <div class="example" data-title="variables">compare: rewardPoints biggerThan: 20</div>
      <p>
        What does it mean for a number to come from "outside" your script?
      </p>
      <div class="example" data-title="variables">calc: foo times: bar</div>
    </section>
    <div class="example" data-title="true and false">true</div>
    <div class="example" data-title="strings">"hello"</div>
